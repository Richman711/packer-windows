Windows Packer Templates

### Introduction

This repository will contain Windows templates that are to be used to create machine images for VMware Workstation using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

I created this repo due to a lake of clear examples of how to create VMware images for workstation from the Packer [documentation](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/vmware/iso).

### Packer Version

[Packer 1.6.2](https://www.packer.io/downloads) have been used during the creation of the templates.

### Windows Versions

The following Windows versions are known to work with VMware Workstaion 15 Pro v.15.5.6:
